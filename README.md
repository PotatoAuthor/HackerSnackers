This is a desktop app that searches the user's Google Calendar schedule
info to suggest recommendations for how they can spend their free time
with friends.

### How it relates to the theme:
The main idea that we based our project on is the restoration of 
relationships. Our program achieves this by recommending activities
that the user can do in their free time with others 
(friends or family). Whether our schedules are busy or we have nothing
to do, it always helps to interact with others, not just for the
restoration of relationships, but also for the restoration of 
our mental health.
