# Brief:
#       Builds the schedule array, in which represents a 15 minute time window. If there is an event during
#       that window, the array contains a 1. Else, it contains a 0. Index 0 is the NEXT 15 minute timeslot from exectution.
#       i.e, if execution occurs at 11:54, 12:00-12:15 is the first index
#
# Parameters:
#           cals_to_check is an array of calendar names that the user wishes to read from
#           service is the object used to make calendar api calls
#           calendars_dict maps calendar names to their ids
#
